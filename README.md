# NUS-Internship-LOR
Dear Sir/Madam,
My name is Siddharth George, and I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the 
National University of Singapore. I am writing to confirm that Bhoumik Mhatre completed a 
research internship with me and my research team during this past summer, from June 
2023 to April 2024.
Bhoumik worked with us on a project that studied the functioning of local governments and 
implementation of development works in rural India. This work required Bhoumik to use 
and develop his data processing, analysis and NLP skills. Bhoumik used and adapted the 
pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to 
classify a large corpus of administrative data on local development projects as public or 
private goods and categorised the beneficiaries as households, neighbourhoods, villages or 
GPs.
Bhoumik needed to analyse a huge administrative dataset which comprised descriptions of
several million local development projects. As these descriptions were in both English and 
Kannada, Bhoumik first created labelled training data using an active learning approach.
Next, Bhoumik created a pipeline to pre-process the data using tokenization, encoding, 
padding with additional information on estimated cost, location and project status. Going 
beyond this, he further automated these pipelines for model specifications and translations 
creating a smooth architecture to use BERT. Comparison metrics such as F1, accuracy 
and in-depth analysis of false positives and negatives helped us understand the predictions 
under various hyper-parameters, weighted loss models and mono and bilingual models.
Despite being his first NLP project, Bhoumikâ€™s performance was excellent. He was able to 
learn and build the code pipeline in Python seamlessly. This shows his strong programming 
skills and his willingness and ability to pick up new machine learning methods and 
techniques. This will surely serve him well in the future and make him an asset to any 
organisation.
More generally, Bhoumik was a pleasure to work with. He is friendly, eager to learn, and 
works well in a team. I recommend him strongly for any internship or position in your 
organisation without any hesitation.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
